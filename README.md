# House-Price-Calculator
This assignment is designed to provide you some experience writing programs with the C programming language. You will write a C program that implements simple “one-shot” machine learning algorithm for predicting house prices in your area. There is significant hype and excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. CS 211 students will get a glimpse of AI/ML by implementing a simple machine learning algorithm to predict house prices based on historical data. For example, the price of the house (y) can depend on certain attributes of the house: number of bedrooms (x1), total size of the house (x2), number of baths (x3), and the year the house was built (x4).
